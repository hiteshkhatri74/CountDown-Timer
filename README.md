The CountDown Timer project is a web application built using JavaScript. It allows users to set a timer for a specified duration and then counts down to zero, displaying the remaining time dynamically. The application updates the time display every second using setInterval, providing a real-time countdown experience. JavaScriptâ€™s DOM manipulation capabilities are used to update the timer display, ensuring that the interface is responsive and interactive. Users can start, pause, and reset the timer, making it a versatile tool for various timing needs.
